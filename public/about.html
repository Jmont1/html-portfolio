<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Jean Montas. I was born in Puerto Rico but moved to the United States when I was one year old. I've always been a fan of technology. Currently, I live in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, and attend Rhode Island College in Providence.

  Ever since I learned that there are countless lines of code behind everything we use, I've been fascinated. As consumers, we often don't think about it. I live with my mom and sisters, and it was my older brother who inspired me to pursue a career in computer science. When I discovered web development, I fell in love with the process and decided to make it my career path.</p>
  
  <p>Fitness, especially weight training and going for walks, is another passion of mine. I'm deeply into self-improvement, but this didn't happen overnight. During my senior year of high school, I was in a rough spot, feeling lost and without direction. I stopped showing up for myself and felt defeated because I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life.
  
  Despite my struggles, I always knew I had an interest in technology and coding. However, I wasn't sure if I wanted to fully commit or if I was capable of handling such a challenging major. After carefully considering my options, I realized that all the majors I was interested in involved technology. This clarity helped me decide that computer science was the right path for me.
  
  After a year at university, learning different coding languages through my courses, I found that I really enjoyed working on projects and began investing my free time in this passion. Now, I'm excited to continue my journey in web development and build a career in this field.</p>
